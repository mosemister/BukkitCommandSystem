# BukkitCommandSystem

The Bukkit Command System is a port of "Core Command System" to the Bukkit platform. 

The Command System makes making commands  whole lot easier, with automatic tab completion and argument processing, all you need to do is write the actual command. 
You get the argument objects already parsed making it hassle free to develop commands. 

Unlike many other command systems that attempt to update the Bukkits original command system that they still use and has been the same since version 1. This command system doesn't use any NMS or craftbukkit calls meaning that projects such as Glowstone, Cauldron, etc will work without those developers needing to reroute the calls. 

## basic command

This is the implementation for a command which gives a player the specified argument
```java
//coming soon
```

Note how the need to parse the string argument to a Material. This command would also suggest all item materials to the player in ID form.
